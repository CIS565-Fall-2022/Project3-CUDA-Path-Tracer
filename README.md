## Introduction

In this project, I implemented a CUDA path tracer for the GPU. Previously in Advanced Rendering, I implemented a Monte Carlo Path Tracer for the CPU. In this project, the path tracer is

## Core Features
1. Shading kernel with BSDF Evaluation for Diffuse and Specular
2. Path continuation/termination using Stream Compaction
3. Contiguous arrangement of materials based on materialId
4. First bounce caching

## Additional Features
### Refractive Material
### Depth of Field
### Stochastic Sampled Anti-Aliasing
### Direct Lighting
### Arbitrary Mesh Loading with TinyObjLoader
### Texture and Bump Mapping

## Bloopers! :)
